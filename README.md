# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Have created the Project of the Notes app using React
One can just download the folder and run npm run dev
I have added features like add a note, delete a note, and edit note, one can edit the note just by clicking on the note there is no need for an extra button.
Or you can just run on the deployed link https://react-notes-eta-five.vercel.app/
